LuaJIT 4f87367b0335d442d3e9dac3fd8ac2788a5756bc

This contains the latest revision (at the time of commit) from the 2.1 develoment branch of LuaJIT
with a few modifications, as listed below.

LuaJIT is linked directly into Dolphin. If you are packaging dolphin for a distro, linking directly
with a shared version of LuaJIT will cause issues, as we have enabled a few features which break
ABI compatablity.

A new msbuild based build system was added for building on windows, the old .bat syetem built
things in-tree and wanted to re-build absolutly everything everytime it ran. msbuild has a few
limitations (features?) that needed to be worked around. It was split up into 3 seperate project
files so that a tool generated by one project could be used by the next to generate files. 
Also, because msbuild requires that every build target must have a unique input file, various
dummy .rule files were added to trigger various targets which generate soruce files.

The following files have been removed from our version in Externals:
  doc/                    -- Documentation
  etc/                    -- man page and pkgconf files for installing on linux
  src/*.bat               -- Various build scrips for windows and console devkits. Removed so we
                             can replace them with better versions that intergrate into our current
							 build system
  src/Makefile            -- Unix build file. Removed for the same reasons.
  src/Makefile.dep        -- Support file for Makefile
  Makefile                -- Top level makefile for installing
  src/luajit.c            -- The luajit command line interpeter, which we don't need.
  src/ljamlg.c            -- Includes all lj_*.c files into a single compile unit for more 
                             agressive optimisation.
  src/host/genlibbc.lua   -- Used to generate buildvm_libbc.h, which is not updated often and baked
                             into the main luajit repo.
  src/host/genminilua.lua -- Used to generate minilua.c, which is updated even less and is also
                             baked into the main luajit repo.
  vaious .gitignore files -- We don't need them as we aren't doing an in-tree build anymore.
 
The following files have been added:
  README-dolphin         -- Docments what has been changed in the "Externals" version of luajit.
  luajit.vcxproj         -- Main visual studio project for luajit
  luajit-buildvm.vcxproj -- Builds the buildvm.exe which is used to generate source files for luajit
  luajit-minilua.vcxproj -- Builds minilua, which is used to generate files for buildvm.exe
  *.vcxproj.filters      -- Sorts the various files in the above projects into nice subdirectories. 
  various *.rule files   -- Empty files to trigger the generation of files by msbuild.
