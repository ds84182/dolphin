This contains the latest revision (at the time of commit) from the 2.1 develoment branch of LuaJIT
with a few modifications, as listed below.

The following files have been removed from our version in Externals:
  doc/                    -- Documentation
  etc/                    -- man page and pkgconf files for installing on linux
  src/*.bat               -- Various build scrips for windows and console devkits. Removed so we
                             can replace them with better versions that intergrate into our current
							 build system
  src/Makefile            -- Unix build file. Removed for the same reasons.
  src/Makefile.dep        -- Support file for Makefile
  Makefile                -- Top level makefile for installing
  src/luajit.c            -- The luajit command line interpeter, which we don't need.
  src/ljamlg.c            -- Includes all lj_*.c files into a single compile unit for more 
                             agressive optimisation.
  src/host/genlibbc.lua   -- Used to generate buildvm_libbc.h, which is not updated often and baked
                             into the main luajit repo.
  src/host/genminilua.lua -- Used to generate minilua.c, which is updated even less and is also
                             baked into the main luajit repo.
  vaious .gitignore files -- We don't need them as we aren't doing an in-tree build anymore.
